Pong is one of the first computer games that ever created, this simple "tennis like" game features
two paddles and a ball, the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain 10 points.
A player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball. The game can be played with two humans players, or
one player against a computer controlled paddle. The game was originally developed by Allan Alcorn and 
released in 1972 by Atari corporations. Soon, Pong became a huge success, and became the first commercially
successful game, on 1975, Atari released a home edition of Pong (the first version was played on Arcade machines)
which sold 150,000 units. Today the Pong Game is considered to be the game which started the video games industry,
as it proved that the video games market can produce signifcant revenues.
Nolan Bushnell founded Atari at 1972 in order to create games and ideas and license them to other companies for mass
production. Pong was actually a training exercise for one of Atari's employees - Allan Alcorn, once it was finished, 
Nolan made few adjustments in order to make the game more interesting (like chaning the ball's return angle) and
added simple sound effects. The first Pong Arcade machine was installed on a local bar, and it was so successful that 
Atari decided to produce and sell the game by themselves, rather then licensing it to other companies. In 1973 
the company finally got a line of credit from Wells Fargo and started an assembly line, by the end of the year, Pong Arcade
machines were shipped to location all over the U.S. as well as to other countries.
Similar to other famous games such as Pacman and Tetris, Pong became one of the symbols of computer gaming.

1. Two paddles
    - One paddle is controlled by "Player/User 1". The second is controlled by either a computer, or another player/user.
    - Operation: Move vertically to "block" the ball.
    - Basic: A bar to represent a paddle, that "hits" a ball back and forth. 
    - Goal: A "stick-figure" person who """thursts""" the ball to their opponent.
2. One ball
    - A ball that travels within the entire 2-D space/boundary. Bounses off of paddles and boundaries.
    - Operation: Move vertially and horizontally across the "open-space"
    - Basic: A ball to represent a "tennis-ball" which gives points to either paddle/opponent.
    - Goal: ???. (Undefined for now)
3. Point system
    - Like a game of tennis, the point system tracks the state of the game between the operators of the paddles.
    - Operation: One an opponent reaches 10 points, they win the game. 
    - Basic: A score-keeper to inform the player(s) the state of the game.
4. Boundaries
    - The space which the ball and paddles are able to move within. Certain sections determine which "paddle-operator" gains a point.
    - Operation: The environment of the game. Holds the paddles and the ball in it.
    - Setup "Areas": [Goal(For paddle 2) | Paddle-1 | Ball-Space | Paddle-2 | Goal(For paddle 1)]
    - Condition: Once the ball reaches the goal area, then the ball has passed one of the paddles. Therefore, the other paddle gains a point.
